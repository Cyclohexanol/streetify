# Introduction

Streetify is a 2D godlike simulation game. It is based on an alien planet where the inhabitants have an underdeveloped civilization. The goal is to macro-manage this civilization in order to prosper as much as possible.

The game offers a canvas with basic content. It is completely opened to modding and encourages the community to create their own content in order to bring the game to the complexity they desire.
